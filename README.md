Music catagory is almost 2x the number of views of next closest catagory (Entertainment)
Youtube could be eating Pandora and Spotify's lunch. Perhaps explaining the push towards youtube music.


![likes](images/likes_by_catagory.png)

Again, music dominates the number of likes.  This also could be an indicator of the demographics of youtube viewers. (ie Music centered interests)

![comments](images/comments_by_catagory.png)

Entertainment closes the gap in terms of comments (ie engagement).  Entertainment catagory might be a good source of sentiment analysis of comments for entertainment products

Unsupervised Clustering of tags into 10 topics

![dist_vids_per_channel](images/dist_videos_per_channel.png)

Vast majority of youtube channels have less than 25 videos.  Distribution is right skewed indicating some super-users who are super-content creators


![disable_ratings](images/Disable_ratings_by_cat.png)

People and Blogs is largest catagory with disabled ratings.  Perhaps because of personal content and not wanting public rating of that content

![Disable_comments_by_cat](images/Disable_comments_by_cat.png)

Again, People & Blogs catagory has disproportunate amount of comments disabled possibly due to not wanting Trolling and internet Vitriol
